- Click "Report a vulnerability"
- Fill out the security advisory form

### 3. Email Security Team
If you prefer to report via email, send details to: security@yourcompany.com

### 4. Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)
- Your contact information
