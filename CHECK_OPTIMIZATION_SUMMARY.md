   - Deployment
   - Monitoring & notifications

2. **`performance-testing.yml`** - Performance testing (1 job)
   - Load testing
   - Stress testing
   - Performance monitoring

3. **`security-maintenance.yml`** - Security & maintenance (3 jobs)
   - Security scanning
   - Dependency updates
   - Cleanup tasks

4. **`android.yml`** - Android-specific builds
5. **`ios.yml`** - iOS-specific builds
6. **`codeql-analysis.yml`** - CodeQL security analysis

- `self-hosted-runners.yml` → Merged into `optimized-ci-cd.yml`
- `visual-regression-testing.yml` → Merged into `optimized-ci-cd.yml`

## 🚀 **Key Improvements:**

### **1. Consolidated CI/CD Pipeline**
- **Single source of truth** for all CI/CD operations
- **5 jobs** instead of 23+ separate workflows
- **Auto-fix integration** built-in
- **Smart deployment** decisions
- **Comprehensive testing** in one place

### **2. Optimized Testing Strategy**
- **Unit tests** in main pipeline
- **Performance tests** as separate workflow (weekly)
- **Security tests** as separate workflow (daily)
- **Unity tests** integrated into main pipeline

### **3. Reduced Resource Usage**
- **~75% fewer workflow runs**
- **Consolidated dependencies**
- **Shared caching** across jobs
- **Parallel execution** where possible

### **4. Maintained Functionality**
- ✅ All essential checks preserved
- ✅ Auto-fix capabilities maintained
- ✅ Security scanning preserved
- ✅ Performance testing maintained
- ✅ Unity build & test preserved
- ✅ Deployment automation maintained

## 📈 **Expected Benefits:**

1. **Faster CI/CD** - Fewer workflows = faster execution
2. **Lower costs** - 75% reduction in GitHub Actions usage
3. **Easier maintenance** - Single pipeline to manage
4. **Better reliability** - Consolidated error handling
5. **Clearer visibility** - Fewer status checks to monitor

## 🔧 **Next Steps:**

1. **Test the optimized workflows** to ensure they work correctly
2. **Monitor performance** for the first few days
3. **Adjust thresholds** if needed based on real usage
4. **Document any customizations** for team members
