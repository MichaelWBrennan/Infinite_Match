## ðŸš€ How to Use

### Unity Integration

1. **Add ARPUInitializer to your main scene:**
   ```csharp
   // In your GameManager or main scene
   var arpuInitializer = gameObject.AddComponent<ARPUInitializer>();
   arpuInitializer.initializeOnStart = true;
   ```

2. **Integrate energy checks in your level system:**
   ```csharp
   // Before starting a level
   if (GameManager.Instance.CanPlayLevel())
   {
       // Start level
       GameManager.Instance.TryConsumeEnergy(1);
   }
   else
   {
       // Show energy purchase UI
   }
   ```

3. **Apply subscription multipliers to rewards:**
   ```csharp
   // When giving rewards
   var multiplier = GameManager.Instance.GetSubscriptionMultiplier(playerId, "coins_multiplier");
   var finalAmount = Mathf.RoundToInt(amount * multiplier);
   ```

4. **Show personalized offers:**
   ```csharp
   // Get offers for player
   var offers = GameManager.Instance.GetPersonalizedOffers(playerId);
   // Display in your shop UI
   ```

5. **Track revenue events:**
   ```csharp
   // When player makes a purchase
   GameManager.Instance.TrackRevenue(playerId, amount, RevenueSource.IAP, itemId);
   ```

### Backend Integration

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test ARPU systems:**
   ```bash
   npm run arpu:test
   ```

3. **Monitor ARPU in real-time:**
   ```bash
   npm run arpu:monitor
   ```
