- **Dynamic**: Adjusts based on platform capabilities

### Compression
- **WebGL**: GZIP for most platforms, Brotli for Poki
- **Mobile**: Native optimization
- **Dynamic**: Client capability detection

### Texture Formats
- **WebGL**: ASTC for modern browsers, DXT for compatibility
- **Mobile**: ASTC for both Android and iOS
- **Dynamic**: Platform capability detection

## Testing

### Platform Optimization Script
- **File**: `scripts/optimize-platforms.js`
- **Features**: Automated platform optimization verification
- **Output**: Platform optimization report

### Platform Detection Testing
- **Command**: `npm run platform:detect`
- **Endpoint**: `/api/platform/detect`
- **Features**: Real-time platform detection testing

## Usage

### 1. Platform Detection
```javascript
// Client-side
const platformDetector = new PlatformDetector();
const platform = await platformDetector.initialize();

// Server-side
const platform = detectPlatform(req);
const optimizations = getPlatformOptimizations(platform);
```

### 2. Platform-Optimized Builds
```javascript
// Unity Cloud Build
const client = new UnityGamingServicesAPIClient();
await client.triggerPlatformOptimizedBuild('poki');
```

### 3. Platform-Specific API
```javascript
// Get platform capabilities
const response = await fetch('/api/platform/detect');
const { platform, capabilities, optimizations } = await response.json();
```
