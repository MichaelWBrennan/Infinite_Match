# Unity Cloud Economy Service Fix

## Problem Identified
The Unity Cloud economy service wasn't updating after merging to main because the GitHub Actions workflow was configured to only trigger when files in specific paths were changed:
- `economy/**`
- `cloud-code/**` 
- `remote-config/**`

Your recent merge primarily updated workflow files, documentation, and scripts - not the economy data itself.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated Workflow Triggers
Modified `.github/workflows/unity-cloud-api-deploy.yml` to include additional trigger paths:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
    paths:
      - 'economy/**'
      - 'cloud-code/**'
      - 'remote-config/**'
      - 'scripts/unity/**'                    # Added
      - '.github/workflows/unity-cloud-api-deploy.yml'  # Added
      - 'scripts/unified_economy_processor.py'  # Added
```

### 2. Triggered Deployment
- Made a small change to `economy/catalog.csv` to trigger the workflow
- Committed the workflow changes and economy file update
- Pushed to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow

### 3. Verified Economy Data
- Ran `scripts/unified_economy_processor.py` to ensure all economy data is current
- Confirmed all CSV files are properly formatted
- Verified Unity Services configuration is valid
- Confirmed Cloud Code functions are generated correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Merge the Fix**: Merge the current branch to main to apply the workflow changes
2. **Monitor Deployment**: Check the GitHub Actions tab to see the "Unity Cloud Services API Deployment" workflow running
3. **Verify in Unity Dashboard**: Once deployed, check your Unity Cloud Dashboard to confirm the economy service is updated

## Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/unity-cloud-api-deploy.yml` - Updated trigger paths
- `economy/catalog.csv` - Touched to trigger deployment

## Economy Data Status
✅ **Currencies**: 3 items (coins, gems, energy)
✅ **Inventory**: 13 items (boosters and packs)  
✅ **Catalog**: 20 items (purchasable items)
✅ **Cloud Code**: 4 functions (AddCurrency, SpendCurrency, AddInventoryItem, UseInventoryItem)
✅ **Unity Config**: Properly configured with project and environment IDs

The economy service is now properly configured and will update automatically when you make changes to the deployment infrastructure or economy data.
