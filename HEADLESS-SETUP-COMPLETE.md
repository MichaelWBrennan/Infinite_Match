- **Test Suite**: Comprehensive headless tests
- **Package Dependencies**: All required Unity packages for testing and building

### ✅ GitHub Actions Workflow
- **Automated Testing**: Runs headless tests on every push
- **Multi-Platform Builds**: Windows, Linux, WebGL, Android, iOS
- **Build Artifacts**: Downloadable builds for each platform
- **Deployment Stubs**: Ready-to-enable deployment to Itch.io, Steam, Google Play, App Store, Netlify

### ✅ Documentation
- **Comprehensive README**: Complete guide for headless development
- **Validation Script**: Automated setup verification
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and solutions
