## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. **Economy Data Flow**
```
CSV Changes → GitHub Push → Validation → Build → Unity Economy → Deploy
```

### 2. **Daily Maintenance**
```
2 AM UTC → Cleanup → Updates → Health Check → Reports → Commit
```

### 3. **Build Process**
```
Code Push → Validate → Build Unity → Generate Assets → Deploy → Notify
```

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. **Unity Services Configuration**
```bash
# Update your project details
cd unity/Assets/StreamingAssets/
# Edit unity_services_config.json with your project ID and environment ID
```

### 2. **Run Initial Setup**
```bash
cd scripts
python3 setup_unity_services.py
```

### 3. **Verify Health**
```bash
cd scripts
python3 health_check.py
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Reports

### **Health Dashboard**
- System health score (0-100)
- Component status monitoring
- Automated issue detection
- Performance metrics

### **Automated Reports**
- Daily maintenance reports
- Performance analytics
- Economy data validation
- Build success/failure tracking

## 🔄 Maintenance Schedule

| Task | Frequency | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Economy Data Validation | Every Push | Validates CSV data integrity |
| Dependency Updates | Daily | Checks for safe updates |
| Performance Monitoring | Continuous | Real-time system metrics |
| Health Checks | Daily | System health assessment |
| Cleanup Tasks | Daily | Removes old artifacts |
| Report Generation | Daily | Creates analytics reports |

## 🚨 Alerts & Notifications

The system automatically:
