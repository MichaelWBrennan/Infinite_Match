# Security Integration Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

Successfully integrated industry-standard anti-cheat and data security solutions into the Evergreen Match-3 Unity game repository using free and open-source technologies.

## 🔒 Security Features Implemented

### Unity Client-Side Security
- **Advanced Security System** - Comprehensive anti-cheat with speed hack detection, memory protection, and fraud detection
- **Client Anti-Cheat** - Real-time client-side validation with behavior analysis and input pattern detection
- **Server Validation** - Secure communication with backend validation system
- **Security Integration** - Unified security management with configurable policies

### Node.js Server-Side Security
- **Enhanced Security Middleware** - Helmet, CORS, rate limiting, input sanitization, XSS protection
- **Anti-Cheat Validator** - Server-side game data validation with impossible value detection
- **Session Management** - JWT-based authentication with secure session handling
- **Security Logging** - Comprehensive audit trails and security event monitoring

```

## 📈 Security Metrics

The system provides comprehensive monitoring with:
- Real-time security event logging
- Player risk score calculation
- Violation tracking and reporting
- Suspicious activity detection
- Performance impact monitoring

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Security Policies
- **Permissive** - Minimal restrictions (testing)
- **Balanced** - Standard protection (production)
- **Strict** - High security (competitive)
- **Paranoid** - Maximum security (high-risk)

### Configurable Thresholds
- Speed hack detection: 1.5x multiplier
- Memory deviation: 30% threshold
- Behavior anomaly: 70% confidence
- Auto-ban: 80% risk score

## 🧪 Testing

Comprehensive test suite includes:
- Server health checks
