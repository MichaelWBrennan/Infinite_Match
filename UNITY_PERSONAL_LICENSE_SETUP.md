# 🎮 Unity Personal License Setup for Headless CI/CD

## Overview
This guide explains how to properly configure your headless CI/CD system to work with Unity's Personal License (no license file required).

## ✅ **What's Already Fixed**

Your repository has been updated to work with Unity Personal License:
- ✅ Removed `UNITY_LICENSE` references from all workflows
- ✅ Updated to use email/password authentication only
- ✅ All GitHub Actions workflows now use `UNITY_EMAIL` and `UNITY_PASSWORD`

## 🔧 **How Unity Personal License Works**

### **No License File Required**
- Unity Personal License is tied to your Unity account
- Authentication happens via email/password
- No `.ulf` license file to download or manage

### **Headless Build Support**
- ✅ **Personal License supports headless builds**
- ✅ **Works with GitHub Actions**
- ✅ **Compatible with game-ci/unity-builder**
- ✅ **Free Unity Cloud Services included**

## 🚀 **Setup Steps**

### 1. **Get Your Unity Account Credentials**
You need your Unity account email and password (the same ones you use to log into Unity Hub).

### 2. **Add GitHub Secrets**
Go to your repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions

Add these secrets:
```
UNITY_EMAIL=your-unity-email@example.com
UNITY_PASSWORD=your-unity-password
UNITY_PROJECT_ID=your-unity-project-id
UNITY_ENV_ID=your-unity-environment-id
UNITY_CLIENT_ID=your-unity-client-id
UNITY_CLIENT_SECRET=your-unity-client-secret
```

### 3. **Test Your Setup**
Push a change to trigger your CI/CD pipeline:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Test Unity Personal License setup"
git push
```

## 📋 **What Happens During Build**

### **Unity License Activation**
1. GitHub Actions downloads Unity Editor
2. Uses your email/password to activate Unity Personal License
3. Runs headless builds without GUI
4. Automatically handles license validation

### **Build Process**
1. **Code Quality** → Auto-fix and validate
2. **Testing** → Run Unity tests headlessly
3. **Building** → Create builds for Windows/Android/iOS
4. **Deployment** → Deploy to Unity Cloud Services
5. **Monitoring** → Health checks and reporting

## ⚠️ **Important Limitations**

### **Unity Personal License Requirements**
- ✅ **Revenue Limit**: Must be under $200K/year
- ✅ **Internet Connection**: Required every 30 days for activation
- ✅ **Headless Builds**: Fully supported
- ✅ **Unity Cloud Services**: Free to use

### **What You CAN'T Do with Personal License**
- ❌ **Unity Build Server**: Not available
- ❌ **Advanced Analytics**: Limited features
- ❌ **Priority Support**: Community support only

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

#### **"License activation failed"**
- **Cause**: Wrong email/password or Unity account issues
- **Solution**: Verify your Unity account credentials in GitHub Secrets

#### **"Unity Editor not found"**
- **Cause**: Unity version mismatch
- **Solution**: Check that your workflow uses the correct Unity version

#### **"Build failed"**
- **Cause**: Project configuration issues
- **Solution**: Check Unity project settings and dependencies

### **Debug Steps**
1. **Check GitHub Actions logs** for detailed error messages
2. **Verify Unity account** can log in manually
3. **Test Unity project** builds locally first
4. **Check Unity Services** configuration

## 🎯 **Your Current Workflow**

### **What Happens on Push**
1. **Code Quality** (0-30 seconds)
   - Auto-fix JavaScript/TypeScript
   - Auto-fix Python code
   - Format JSON files
   - Commit fixes automatically

2. **Testing** (1-3 minutes)
   - Run unit tests
   - Run Unity tests (headless)
   - Health checks
   - Security scans

3. **Building** (2-5 minutes)
   - Build Unity project (Windows/Android/iOS)
   - Upload build artifacts
   - Deploy to Unity Cloud Services

4. **Monitoring** (ongoing)
   - Health monitoring
   - Performance tracking
   - Error detection
